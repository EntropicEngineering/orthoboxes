add serial number
	store it in EEPROM
	make it a working string descriptor, noteworthy because it must be in RAM
	on startup: read from EEPROM into ram
	add command to update firmware
		maybe not?

use ben's console API to interact with new non-HID boxes

Definitely a firmware bug: When the working (+ extra light) box was given all 255 as config to do random, it would successfully complete after the first poke.
	this only happened at sawbones
	it was on at the same time as another one
	slight variation where it completes totally automatically, might not be related. (aka completes instantly)

inaccessible light turns on: matt: by the way this is the bug I mentioned to you repeatedly that the UMN and IA students were reporting that you insisted you already fixed

"Timestamp isnâ€™t behaving as expected" from ben, no info otherwise

self-calibration? some stuff written on whiteboard behind me

peggy and pokey use the exact same report descriptor
	which means that the timestamp report on peggy has an extra ten bytes for pokey order that are unused and annoying

Bootloader
	Keep / replace?
		use a USB DFU one?
	Means to update bootloader
	Handle Serial Number in progmem
	current situation:
		ATMEL uses a custom variant of DFU
			supported by dfu-programmer
		there is a WebUSB implementation of dfu-util, a spec compliant DFU
		dfu-programmer works
			bootloading confirmed
			launching unconfirmed
				not responding to dfu-programmer atmega32u4 launch (with or without --no-reset)
		dfu-util doesn't
			runs a different protocol
		web dfu-util doesn't
			same protocol as dfu-util presumably
